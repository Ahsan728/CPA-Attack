# CPA-Attack @ESISAR
## Introduction to Correlation Power Analysis
This laboratory involves hands-on experimentation by making use of Correlation Power Analysis (CPA) techniques on an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implementation coded in C, running on a STM32 ARM-based microcontroller. The main goal will be to study the AES algorithm and the STM32 â€“ Nucleo Printed Circuit Board (PCB) and propose a measurement method. Then power traces will be captured with the use of an Oscilloscope. The attack will be completed by performing CPA on the captured traces.

- Task 1: Preparing the NUCLEO board for a CPA attack
- Task 2: Focusing the attack based on the maximum leakage
- Task 3: Explaination of the interface of the AES with the computer
- Task 4: Performing attack through Matlab script
